# sample-chat-app (with GunDB)

## About
This is a quick example chat app utilizing React w/GunDB to handle any realtime updates and concurrency concerns.
GunDB is an open source decentralized graph database - more info on it here: https://gun.eco/

To follow along with development notes and updates, I highly suggest reading the notes for each release tags.

### Installation/Launch:
Just install dependencies with:
`npm i`
And spool up the server with:
`npm start`

### Usage:
Visit the application at:
`localhost:8080`
