## About
This is a quick example chat app utilizing React w/GunDB to handle any realtime updates and concurrency concerns.
GunDB is an open source decentralized graph database - more info on it here: https://gun.eco/

To follow along with development notes and updates, I highly suggest reading the notes for each release tag.
