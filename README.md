# sample-chat-app (with GunDB)

## About
This is a quick example chat app utilizing React w/GunDB to handle any realtime updates and concurrency concerns.
GunDB is an open source decentralized graph database - more info on it here: https://gun.eco/

To follow along with development notes and updates, I highly suggest reading the notes for each release tags.

## Setup and Running
### Prerequisites:
Node 10.8+ (should be safe with 8+, but run at your own risk)

Clone this repo. Optionally, checkout your desired release tag.
```
git clone https://github.com/casthewiz/sample-chat-app.git
git checkout 2019-05-26.2

Just install dependencies with 
`npm i`,
then spool up an instance locally with 
`npm start`

### Usage:
Visit the application at:
